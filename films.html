    </div>
    <p>The origin of Darth Vader is finally revealed. A young Obi-Wan and his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, discover a child powerful in the force. Little do they know, the Sith have risen from the ashes and they, too, are interested in the child's potential. Qui-Gon dies protecting young Anakin Skywalker and entrusts Obi-Wan with the training of the boy. Skywalker leaves his mother behind and learns the way of the force. Years later his mother is savagely murdered by Tusken Raiders and the darkness within Anakin awakens. The chosen one marries the Senator from Naboo, Padme Amidala, and they are expecting twins. But the hero is plagued by nightmares of her death and fearing that the Jedi won't help him save her, he turns to the dark side of the force. This all culminates in a duel of the heroes between Kenobi and Skywalker, leaving Anakin badly scarred and the remaining few Jedi on the run from the Empire.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Luke Skywalker is a farm boy looking for adventure, which finds him in the form of two robots, R2-D2 and C3PO. They are carrying a message from Princess Leia for the former Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke sets off with Kenobi and two smugglers, Han and Chewi, to save the princess. The gang saves the princess, but Kenobi is seemingly killed by Vader and so Luke begins his force learning journey. The crew have many adventures together and Luke is told by a force ghost version of Kenobi that to level up, he must be trained by the Grand Master Yoda on Dagobah. Young Skywalker commits himself to his training, but his friends are in danger! Yoda tells Luke that he can't save them, but he goes anyway. Luke loses a limb and nearly his life, but Han is still captured and frozen in carbon. Not only that, but Vader is Luke's son. Knowing this, Luke can't kill the man that was once known as Anakin Skywalker. Luke submits to Vader and tells him that he won't kill his father. It's only after seeing his son being tortured by Palpatine that Anakin snaps out of it and returns to the light side of the force. The Empire dies with Palpatine and Vader and Anakin lives on through the force like Obi-Wan. All over the galaxy, people celebrate the new hope that has been given to them.</p>
    <h2>The Sequels</h2>
    <div>
        <img src="../images/sequels.webp" alt="Total garbage" class="ST">
    </div>
    <p>Honestly I don't know how I can make this trilogy sound cool. A lot of wasted material. This would have been a good opportunity to use the revived Maul, Ahsoka, Ezra, Thrawn, etc, Also the sequels should have been done twenty years ago with the OG cast. But if not, it should have been done far in the future with a new Jedi Order. Just awful.</p>
    <h2>Star Wars Stories</h2>

    </div>
    <p>Solo tells the story of Han before the events of A New Hope. Him and his girlfriend are orphans who live in the shadows of their world. They eventually are torn apart and Han goes his own way, acting as a storm trooper. He's eventually caught and is forced into a cell with a big hairy monster, also known as Chewbaca. They escape together and go on many adventures, eventually meeting Lando Calrissian and winning the Millenium Falcon. </p>
    <p>Rogue One tries to cover the plot hole of the Death Star in A New Hope. Why was there a little opening in the moon-like structure that could destroy the entire vessel? This is explored in R1.</p>
